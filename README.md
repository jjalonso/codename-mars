> :fork_and_knife: Starter with Babel.js and Webpack

## Getting started

You can start in two ways:

## How to build the application?

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Your source will be minified.

## How to develop the application?

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Remove generated directory

If you would like to remove `dist` directory (created by Webpack):

```
$ npm run clear
```

If you would like to remove `node_modules/` and remove `dist/`

```
$ npm run clear:all
```
